## Backend

Postman was used to test the API for CRUD operations. Please refer to the video for the full explanation and examples.

**FLASK-restful-app:**

The following libraries were added to support the app.route function:
```
import requests
import sqlite3 as sql
import urllib
from random import randint
from flask import Flask, render_template, url_for, request
```
The recipe APP was created by executing the code below:
```
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
def home():
    return render_template("ZKHP.html")
```
Running the app.py file would result in:

**Cloud App:**

This application is served over the Heroku cloud platform.

The application is not currently load balanced but supports HTTPS for the deployment of the app.

To run the app on your local machine you can use the command:
```
  $ flask run --cert=adhoc
```

## Front End

The current version of the front-end can only be ran locally. It was successfully tested on macOS Big Sur launched over the command line. The IOS simulator or Android emulator can be launched through the web interface of the local server. Node.js is required alongside with the respective Node version, please see nvm and docker section above in further detail.

## HTTPS Serving

The https serving was utilised using SSL, simply by adding this line of code at the end of the app.py file:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')
    
This serves the apps ip through a https server.

## Database

Furthermore, i created a database, using SQLAlchemy which had to be grabbed externally as Flask does not serve this functionality, this can be found in the db.py file, and the run.py file. There was also a checkpasswordsafe.py file, this authenticated users through checking the database to see if their username and password was saved on the system.
